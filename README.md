# [Solar2D Free Plugin Directory](https://plugins.solar2d.com/)

This directory contains plugins available for Solar2D/CoronaSDK game engine.

# Adding your plugin
To add plugin with automated publishing create a [new issue](https://github.com/solar2d/plugins.solar2d.com/issues/new) explaining what plugin does, desired publisherId and plugin.name. If plugin would be approved you will get a write access to the GitHub repository and instructions on how to publish your plugin.



## Errors

Some vendors choose to run their own store, and host plugins there. For them, they can specify their own custom error message with link to their store. Example is `plugins/tech.scotth_plugin.classKit.json`:
```json
{
    "plugin": "plugin.classKit",
    "publisherId": "tech.scotth",
    "error": "Plugin is not provided by Solar2D Free directory, but can be activated [here](https://solar2dmarketplace.com/plugins?ClassKit_scotth-tech)."
}
```
Create PR for your plugins.
